# Mini-CNC : M&M-CNC

### Description : Create a miniture CNC machine with ready made parts, limited 3D printed parts, and basic hobby circuitry 

##### General Requirements 

1. CNC both wood and aluminium 
2. Use only ready made kit parts, precut, or rapid prototyped (laser cut or 3D print) 
3. Use AC power, no battery

##### Technical Requirements 

1. 3-axis degrees of freedom 
2. x-axis: +- 400 mm minimum 
3. y-axis: +- 400mm minimum
4. z-axis: +- 200 mm minimum 
5. Bit sizes between 10mm and 1 mm 
6. Spindle Speed 6000 rpm
7. Feed rate 200 ipm 
8. Max Budget: 300$
